# Power BI E-Commerce Sales Analysis

### Project Overview

The objective of this project is to provide insights into the sales of a fictional e-commerce company, named World Wide Items (WWI). From these insights I will gain a deeper understanding of the company's sales performance, which will assist me in identifying trends and making data-driven recommendations.

### Data Sources

- Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "FactSale.csv", which contains data regarding each sale made by the company.
- Stock Data: The "StockItem.csv" file contains data regarding the products that are in stock for sale.
- Employee Data: The "DimEmployee.csv" dataset contains data about the WWI's employees.
- Customer Data: The "DimCustomer.csv" file contains data regarding the customers WWI has sold their products to.
- Location Data: The "DimCity.csv" file contains data regarding all the different locations where WWI has made sales.
- Dates Data: The "DimDate.csv" file contains data regarding all dates between 2013 and 2016.
